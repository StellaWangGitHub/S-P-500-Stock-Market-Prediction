# S&P-500-Stock-Market-Prediction

Ongoing Personal Project till the end of this month

Comparing the performance between traditional time series analysis ARIMA models with modern deep learning using TensorFlow2


May 24 : Need to understand the different performance with other python package like numpy. Why we use it? Think about reasons.

May 25 : 
• Processed and visualized time series data
• Used Keras to create a recurrent neural network forecasting stock prices

June 25 : 
• Complete this project
• Uploaded the R file. I used ARIMA models to train the data, and the error is .
• Uploaded the .ipynb file. I used deep learning method to train the data, and the error is .


 Make conclusion.
