# S&P-500-Stock-Market-Prediction

Personal Project till the end of June.

The main purpose of this project is to compare the performance between traditional time series analysis ARIMA models with modern deep learning using TensorFlow2.

This is a fun practice, I really enjoy it! I know I still have a long way to go before I can be a TensorFlow2 Skywalker:)



May 24 : Need to understand the different performance with other python package like numpy. Why we use it? Think about reasons.

May 25 : 
• Processed and visualized time series data
• Used Keras to create a recurrent neural network forecasting stock prices

June 25 : 
• Completed this project and will git the rest of files very soon
• Uploaded the R file. I used 3 ARIMA models to train the data, used validation and chose the model with least error.
• Uploaded the .ipynb file. I used deep learning method to train the data
