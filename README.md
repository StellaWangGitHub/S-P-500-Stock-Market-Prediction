• Uploaded the R file. I used ARIMA models to train the data, used validation and chose the model with least error to conduct the prediction.


##Introduction
The data collected is the S&P 500 data from Specifically, the variables include Date, Opening Price, High Price of the Day, Low Price of the Day, Closing Price, Adjusted Closing Price, and Volume. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance.
We are interested in exploring the properties of the volume of this dataset and determining if it has any time series properties. 





Future Step:
• Start to learn PyTorch to train the dataset. It's probably going to be fun!
